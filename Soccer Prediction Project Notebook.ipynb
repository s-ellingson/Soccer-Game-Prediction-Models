    "Now that match data has been scraped, I can add an additional feature: team ratings. This is formulated on a structure closely related to the Elo rating system (used in another professional environment - [chess](https://medium.com/purple-theory/what-is-elo-rating-c4eb7a9061e0)). The basics of how this approach works are as follows:\n",
    "- All teams begin with the same rating.\n",
    "- At the end of each game, ratings are updated.\n",
    "- The extent to which ratings are changed depends on the matchup itself. For example:\n",
    "    - An \"underdog\" playing who wins against a much higher rated team gets a large increase in rating, while an expected victory will only get the higher rated team a few points in increase.\n",

Dynamic web pages, which are becoming more common, inhibit simple web scrapers from obtaining all page information from simply loading the specific URL. I found that there were many chances to get further game information that would require this dynamic element. In the future, we could implement a more complex web scraping implementation to get more features.\n",

The automation of this process could even culminate with alerts sent to an individual's device with matchweek predictions!"
